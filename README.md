# Payment Reconciliation Dashboard

A full-stack payment reconciliation system that matches internal payment records against external provider data (Stripe, PayPal, bank transfers) using a confidence-based scoring engine.

Built as a portfolio project demonstrating real-world fintech patterns: async Python, React dashboards, workflow automation, and natural language querying.

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peelmicro/payment-reconciliation-dashboard.git
cd payment-reconciliation-dashboard
```

### Option 1 — Docker Compose (full stack)

```bash
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env   # Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for Ask AI feature)
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL on port **5432**
- n8n on port **5678** (http://localhost:5678)
- API on port **8000** (http://localhost:8000)
- Web on port **3000** (http://localhost:3000)

### Option 2 — Local development

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 16 running locally.

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL and n8n (Docker)
docker compose up -d postgres n8n

# 2. Backend
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env             # Edit DATABASE_URL and add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
fastapi dev app/main.py          # http://localhost:8000

# 3. Frontend (new terminal)
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:5173
```

### Populate data

After starting the stack, the database is empty. First verify the API is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}
```

Then populate data using one of these 4 options:

#### Option A — One-command script (recommended)

Requires `curl` installed (standard on macOS/Linux).

```bash
npm run initial-seed
```

This runs `scripts/initial-seed.sh` which sequentially: checks API health, seeds 3 currencies (USD, EUR, GBP), 3 providers (Stripe, PayPal, Bankinter), 3 merchants (2 Spain, 1 UK), generates 15 fake payments, simulates Stripe/PayPal/bank records, generates 2 orphan records per provider (to demonstrate the `missing_internal` status — see [Reconciliation statuses](#reconciliation-statuses)), and runs the reconciliation engine.

![Initial seed](docs/initial-seed.png)
*Terminal output of `npm run initial-seed` — 8 sequential API calls with progress.*

#### Option B — Manual curl commands

```bash
# 1. Seed reference data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/seed/currencies
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/seed/providers
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/seed/merchants

# 2. Generate internal payments (count=1..50, default 5)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/payments/generate?count=15"

# 3. Simulate provider records
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/stripe-payments/simulate
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/paypal-payments/simulate
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/bank-payments/simulate

# 4. (Optional) Generate orphan provider records to demonstrate missing_internal
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/stripe-payments/simulate-orphan?count=2"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/paypal-payments/simulate-orphan?count=2"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/bank-payments/simulate-orphan?count=2"

# 5. Run reconciliation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/reconciliations/run
```

#### Option C — Swagger UI

1. Open http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Execute each POST endpoint in order:
   - `POST /seed/currencies` → `POST /seed/providers` → `POST /seed/merchants`
   - `POST /payments/generate` (set `count` to 15)
   - `POST /stripe-payments/simulate` → `POST /paypal-payments/simulate` → `POST /bank-payments/simulate`
   - `POST /reconciliations/run`

![Swagger UI](docs/swagger.png)
*Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs` — all endpoints grouped by tag (seed, payments, stripe, paypal, bank, reconciliation, ask).*

#### Option D — n8n workflows

1. Open n8n at http://localhost:5678
2. Import all 7 JSON files from `n8n/workflows/` (see [How to import workflows](#how-to-import-workflows) below)
3. Execute manually in order: **WF1** (seed) → **WF2** (payments, run a few times) → **WF3** (Stripe) → **WF4** (PayPal) → **WF5** (bank) → **WF7** (optional — orphan records for `missing_internal`) → **WF6** (reconciliation)
4. **Publish** WF2–WF6 to activate their cron schedules for continuous data generation (WF7 stays manual — orphans are incidents, not a periodic flow)

After populating, open http://localhost:3000 to see the dashboard with data.

![Dashboard home](docs/home.png)
*Dashboard home — match rate, total reconciled, status breakdown by type, provider distribution, and daily trends.*

## Reconciliation Algorithm

The engine scores each provider payment (candidate) against all unreconciled internal payments and selects the best match above a **65% confidence threshold**.

### Scoring criteria

| Criteria | Points | When scored |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Amount — exact match | +100 | Always |
| Amount — after fee (net ≈ external) | +80 | Always |
| Amount — within 5% tolerance | +50 | Always |
| Card BIN + last4 | +50 | Both records have card data |
| IBAN country + last4 | +50 | Both records have IBAN data |
| VAT number | +50 | Both records have VAT |
| Date — same day | +30 | Always |
| Date — within 1 day | +20 | Always |
| Date — within 7 days | +10 | Always |

**Confidence** = `(score / max_possible_score) × 100`

The `max_possible_score` is calculated **dynamically** — a criterion is only added to the maximum if both the internal payment and the provider record have data for that field. This ensures fair comparison across provider types:

- A PayPal wallet payment (no card/IBAN) has max 180 pts (100 + 50 VAT + 30 date). Score 180/180 = **100%**.
- A Stripe card payment has max 230 pts (100 + 50 card + 50 VAT + 30 date). Score 230/230 = **100%**.

Both are equally strong matches despite having different field sets.

![Scoring example](docs/scoring-example.png)
*Reconciliation detail — shows `Score: X / max_score` and computed `Confidence %` alongside the matching provider and internal records.*

### Reconciliation statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `matched` | Exact amount match above threshold |
| `matched_with_fee` | Net amount (after fee) matches external |
| `amount_mismatch` | Fields match but amount differs |
| `missing_internal` | Provider has a record; we don't |
| `missing_external` | We have a record; provider doesn't (yet) |
| `duplicate` | Multiple internal records above threshold |
| `disputed` | Manually flagged for review |

> **Demo tip — how to generate `missing_internal` and `missing_external`:**
>
> - **`missing_internal`** requires a provider record with no matching internal payment. Use the orphan simulation endpoints: `POST /stripe-payments/simulate-orphan?count=N`, `POST /paypal-payments/simulate-orphan?count=N`, `POST /bank-payments/simulate-orphan?count=N`. The `npm run initial-seed` script generates 2 orphans per provider automatically.
> - **`missing_external`** requires an internal payment with no matching provider record. Run `POST /payments/generate` then `POST /reconciliations/run` **without** calling the simulate endpoints first.

### Dashboard pages

The frontend exposes four views, all populated from the same API endpoints:

![Transactions](docs/transactions.png)
*Transactions page — internal payments with filters for status, provider, and method.*

![Reconciliations list](docs/reconciliations-list.png)
*Reconciliations list — paginated grid with status filter, confidence column, and click-through to detail.*

![Reconciliation detail](docs/reconciliation-detail.png)
*Reconciliation detail — internal vs external record, delta, and scoring breakdown.*

![Missing external](docs/missing-external.png)
*Missing external — internal payments that have no matching provider record yet.*

![Trends](docs/trends.png)
*Daily reconciliation trends — stacked bar chart across N days (Recharts), aggregated by Pandas on the API side.*

## n8n Workflows

All workflows are exported as JSON files in `n8n/workflows/` and can be imported into any n8n instance.

| Workflow | File | Trigger | What it does |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| WF1 | `WF1_seed_base_data.json` | Manual | Seeds 3 currencies (USD, EUR, GBP), 3 providers (Stripe, PayPal, Bankinter), and 3 merchants (2 Spain, 1 UK) |
| WF2 | `WF2_generate_fake_payments.json` | Every 5 min | Generates 5 fake internal payments |
| WF3 | `WF3_simulate_stripe.json` | Every 10 min | Simulates Stripe records from recent card payments |
| WF4 | `WF4_simulate_paypal.json` | Every 30 min | Simulates PayPal records from recent card/wallet payments |
| WF5 | `WF5_simulate_bank.json` | Every 1 hour | Simulates bank transfer records from recent bank payments |
| WF6 | `WF6_run_reconciliation.json` | Every 15 min | Runs the reconciliation engine |
| WF7 | `WF7_simulate_orphans.json` | Manual | Generates 2 orphan records per provider (Stripe, PayPal, bank) — demonstrates `missing_internal` status |

![n8n workflows](docs/n8n-workflows.png)
*n8n workflow list — 7 imported workflows; cron-scheduled ones are toggled Active, WF1 and WF7 stay manual.*

![n8n execution](docs/n8n-execution.png)
*Successful execution of WF6 (reconciliation) — each HTTP node shows its response payload for inspection.*

### How to import workflows

1. Start the stack: `docker compose up -d` (or `npm run dc:up`)
2. Open n8n at http://localhost:5678
3. Click **"+"** → **"Workflow"** to create a new workflow
4. Click the **three dots menu (...)** at the top right → **"Import from file"**
5. Select a JSON file from `n8n/workflows/`
6. Click **"Execute workflow"** to test manually
7. Toggle **"Publish"** to activate the cron schedule

> **Note:** The API server must be running for workflows to work. Workflows call `http://host.docker.internal:8000` to reach the API from inside Docker.

---

## Ask AI (Natural Language Queries)

The `/ask` endpoint accepts plain-text questions in English or Spanish and returns answers from the database.

```bash
# Example
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the match rate for this week?"}'
```

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `apps/api/.env`.

The endpoint uses a two-step LangChain chain:
1. Generate SQL from the question (Claude reads the schema)
2. Execute the SQL, then generate a natural language answer from the results

![Ask AI](docs/ask-ai.png)
*Ask AI page — natural language question → generated SQL → natural language answer.*

## Testing

### Run all tests

```bash
npm run api:test    # pytest
npm run web:test    # vitest
```

### Test breakdown

| File | Tests | What it covers |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `tests/test_engine.py` | 21 | Scoring engine: amount, currency, card, IBAN, VAT, date proximity, confidence |
| `tests/test_endpoints.py` | 15 | FastAPI endpoints: health, list, summary, detail (mocked session) |
| `tests/test_service.py` | 11 | Service helpers: status mapping, provider ID, currency lookup, reconciliation flow |
| `src/lib/format.test.ts` | 5 | Currency formatting utilities |
| `src/lib/status-colors.test.ts` | 6 | Status badge color mapping |
| `src/components/layout.test.tsx` | 3 | Navigation layout render and links |

**Total: 61 tests**

### Testing approach

- **API**: `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = auto`, `httpx.AsyncClient` with `ASGITransport` for in-process endpoint testing, `AsyncMock` dependency overrides to avoid real database connections.
- **Frontend**: Vitest with `jsdom` environment, `@testing-library/react` for component rendering, `MemoryRouter` wrapping for route-dependent components.

## Assumptions

1. **Amounts in cents** — all monetary values are stored as integers in minor currency units (e.g., 4999 = €49.99). Never floats.
2. **Separate provider tables** — `stripe_payments`, `paypal_payments`, and `bank_transfer_payments` each have provider-specific fields, rather than a polymorphic single table.
3. **Scoring over exact key matching** — real-world provider data rarely has a clean foreign key back to internal records. Confidence scoring handles partial information gracefully.
4. **VAT number as linking field** — in European payments, the merchant VAT number is a reliable cross-system identifier available in both internal and external records.
5. **65% confidence threshold** — chosen to be permissive enough to handle real-world data skew while strict enough to avoid false positives.
6. **n8n for data simulation** — provider workflows (Stripe, PayPal, bank) simulate what real webhooks would provide, demonstrating the full reconciliation lifecycle without live provider credentials.
7. **Single-currency dashboard** — the summary KPIs aggregate all currencies together. Multi-currency breakdown is a natural extension (see below).
8. **Human-readable codes** — format `PREFIX-YYYY-MM-SEQUENCE` (e.g., `PAY-2026-03-000012`) using a `code_sequences` table with a per-prefix counter to guarantee uniqueness without gaps.

---

## Decisions Postponed

These were considered but intentionally deferred to keep scope appropriate for the assessment:

| Decision | Why deferred |
|----------|-------------|
| Mixed-currency dashboard totals | Requires exchange rate data; adds significant complexity for limited demo value |
| Real provider webhooks (Stripe, PayPal) | Needs live credentials and a public endpoint; n8n simulation is equivalent for the demo |
| Alembic database migrations | Alembic is a Python migration tool for SQLAlchemy that tracks schema changes incrementally (like versioned SQL scripts). `create_all` is acceptable for a seed-based demo; Alembic would be required in production to safely evolve the schema without losing data |
| Per-merchant reconciliation rules | Different merchants may need different scoring thresholds; not required for the demo dataset |
| n8n workflow pagination | Provider simulation workflows fetch all records; real workflows would need cursor-based pagination |
| Real BIN database lookup | Card BIN matching uses stored values; a production system would validate against a live BIN database |

---

## What I Would Do Differently

1. **Alembic for migrations** — Alembic generates incremental migration scripts (e.g., "add column X to table Y") that can be applied and rolled back safely. Currently, `create_all` on startup drops and recreates everything, which is fine for a demo but would destroy production data on schema changes.
2. **Event-driven reconciliation** — instead of polling every 15 minutes (WF6), trigger reconciliation when a new provider record arrives via webhook.
3. **Idempotent provider ingestion** — the simulation workflows insert new records on every run; a real system would use provider transaction IDs as unique constraints to prevent duplicates.
4. **Per-merchant scoring rules** — some merchants have higher fee variance or longer settlement windows; the scoring thresholds should be configurable per merchant.
5. **Async LangChain** — the `/ask` endpoint uses a synchronous LangChain chain in an async FastAPI endpoint; this blocks the event loop. A production implementation would use `langchain_anthropic.astream` or run in a thread pool.
6. **Structured logging** — replace `print` statements with structured JSON logs (using `structlog`) for easier aggregation in a log management system.
7. **Caching for reference data** — currencies, merchants, and providers are loaded from the database on every request; an in-memory cache with a short TTL would reduce database load significantly.

---

## How to Extend for Production

| Concern | Approach |
|---------|---------|
| **Container orchestration** | Deploy the `api` and `web` Docker images to any container platform — Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or Azure Container Apps |
| **Database** | Replace the Docker PostgreSQL with a managed service (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL) with automated backups and read replicas |
| **Migrations** | Add Alembic for schema version control — each schema change becomes a versioned migration script that can be applied (`alembic upgrade head`) or rolled back (`alembic downgrade`). Run as an init container before the API starts |
| **Secrets** | Store `DATABASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and other secrets in a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) |
| **Observability** | Add structured logging, metrics (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry), and distributed tracing |
| **CI/CD** | Build and push Docker images on merge to main; deploy with a rolling update strategy |
| **Real provider webhooks** | Replace n8n simulation workflows with real Stripe/PayPal webhook endpoints that ingest provider data in real time |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Add `tenant_id` to all tables and row-level security policies in PostgreSQL for SaaS deployment |

---

## Trade-offs

| Decision | Trade-off |
|----------|----------|
| Scoring-based matching | More flexible than exact key matching, but requires tuning thresholds per business context |
| Separate provider tables | Cleaner schema and type safety, but adding a new provider requires a new table + migration |
| n8n for workflows | No-code visual orchestration is easy to monitor, but adds an extra service and couples the demo to n8n's data model |
| Dynamic max_score | Fair confidence % across provider types, but harder to explain to non-technical stakeholders than a fixed scale |
| Pandas for trends | Clean aggregation code, but pulls all reconciliation rows into memory — would need chunking for large datasets |
| LangChain two-step chain | Reliable SQL generation + NL answer, but makes 2 LLM calls per question; a single call with tool use would be more efficient |

## AI Tools Used

This project was developed with **Claude Code** (Anthropic's CLI tool). Per the assessment instructions, all AI assistance is documented here:

- **Architecture decisions** — discussed scoring engine design, provider table separation, and n8n workflow structure with Claude Code.
- **Code generation** — FastAPI routers, SQLAlchemy models, React components, TanStack Query hooks, and Dockerfile configurations were written with Claude Code assistance.
- **Test suite** — pytest fixtures, mock session strategies, and Vitest component tests were developed iteratively with Claude Code.
- **Debugging** — resolved issues including nested `.git` repository (Vite init), Docker `npm ci` lock file mismatch, and ruff `# noqa` inside triple-quoted strings.
- **Documentation** — this README and the n8n workflow export instructions were written with Claude Code.
- **CLAUDE.md** — the repository includes a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root, which provides project conventions, structure, and coding guidelines that Claude Code uses as context when assisting with development.

All generated code was reviewed, understood, and validated before being committed.
